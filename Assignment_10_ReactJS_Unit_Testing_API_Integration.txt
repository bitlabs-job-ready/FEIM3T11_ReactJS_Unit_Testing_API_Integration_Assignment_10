Create a React component that displays a list of products from an API. The API endpoint will be provided to you. Each product should have a title, description, image, and price. 

Use axios or any other library to make the API call and fetch the products data from the API endpoint. 

Using Jest , write unit tests to test the following: 

The component correctly makes the API call and fetches the products data 

The component renders correctly with the fetched data 

The component displays the correct number of products 

The component displays the correct title, description, image and price for each product 

The component correctly handles any errors or issues with the API call. 

Submit your component code, unit tests and the API endpoint results (if needed) for grading.
